## Task: Understanding Arrow Functions and Async/Await in JavaScript

### Task Objectives

- Understand and explain how to write an arrow function in JavaScript.
- Define what async and await mean in JavaScript and how they are used.

---

### Instructions

1. **Arrow Functions**

   - Begin by writing a basic function that takes two numbers as input, adds them together, and returns the sum.

   ```ts
   // add your traditional function here
   ```

   - Then, rewrite this function using arrow function syntax.

   ```ts
   // add your arrow function here
   ```

   - Provide an explanation that includes:
     - The syntax of an arrow function, highlighting the use of parentheses, the arrow symbol (`=>`), and curly braces `{ }`.
     - Key differences between arrow functions and traditional functions in JavaScript.

2. **Async and Await**

   - Research what `async` and `await` mean in JavaScript.
   - Explain:
     - What `async` does when placed before a function.
     - How `await` works within an async function and why it's used.
     - What happens if I forget to add await in the steps of an async function?
